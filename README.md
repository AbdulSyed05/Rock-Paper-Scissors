# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Portfolio Project 2

Rock, Paper, Scissors" is a simple hand game that is often used as a decision-making tool or a quick and fun game between two people. The game is typically played with the hands in a count of three, and each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand.

The rules of Rock-paper-scissors are:

Scissors cut paper
Paper covers rock
Rock breaks scissors

## Rules of Memory Game

1. Each player forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand:
   - Rock (a fist)
   - Paper (an open hand)
   - Scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V)

2. The players count to three in unison and simultaneously throw one of the three shapes.

3. The winner is determined based on a set of rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors (Rock crushes Scissors)
   - Scissors beats Paper (Scissors cut Paper)
   - Paper beats Rock (Paper covers Rock)

If both players choose the same shape, the game is a tie, and they typically play again. RPS is a game of chance, as there is no skill involved in choosing a shape, making it a popular and fair way to make quick decisions or settle disputes. It's also a common game used in various contexts, including as a simple hand game for children or as a playful way to make choices between adults.

## User Story:
As a casual player of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, I want the game to be more engaging and intuitive by introducing gesture recognition. The game should be able to recognize and respond to the gestures made by the player. This includes recognizing the gestures for "rock," "paper," and "scissors."

#### Design Choices
One key design choice for enhancing the user experience in this Rock, Paper, Scissors game in JavaScript is to implement a dynamic AI opponent. This dynamic AI opponent adapts its strategy based on the user's gameplay patterns and skill level.
