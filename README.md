# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Milestone Project 2

Rock, Paper, Scissors" is a simple hand game that is often used as a decision-making tool or a quick and fun game between two people. The game is typically played with the hands in a count of three, and each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand.

The rules of Rock-paper-scissors are:

Scissors cut paper
Paper covers rock
Rock breaks scissors
