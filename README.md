# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## Milestone Project 2

Rock, Paper, Scissors" is a simple hand game that is often used as a decision-making tool or a quick and fun game between two people. The game is typically played with the hands in a count of three, and each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand.

The rules of Rock-paper-scissors are:

Scissors cut paper
Paper covers rock
Rock breaks scissors

## Project Goals

Develop an interactive and accessible Rock, Paper, Scissors game in JavaScript that provides an engaging gaming experience for users of all ages while promoting skill development, fair play, and user satisfaction

## User Story:
As a casual player of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, I want the game to be more engaging and intuitive by introducing gesture recognition. The game should be able to recognize and respond to the gestures made by the player. This includes recognizing the gestures for "rock," "paper," and "scissors."
